# Url Tools

This is a URL parsing C# library based on the living standard as declared by the [WHATWG](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/).

## Gettings Started

This .Net library is written in C# and is compatible with .Net Standard 2.0 which allows it to be used in most applications including .Net Core, .Net Framework, Mono and Xamarin applications.

## Prerequisits

The current version of the tool is being compiled on Visual Studio 2017 and has a solution file that is designed to work with this version. Migrating into Visual Studio 2019 will happen in the future, but so far, the software will stay on 2017.

## Installing

The tool is a regular .Net linked library and needs to be referenced by the project that wants to use it.

## Setup
